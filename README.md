# Dotfiles and Bootstrap

This is my old Bootstrap Script for a WSL 2 Ubuntu development environment and was used in conjunction with [yadm](https://yadm.io/#).
It has since been superseded by an alternative implementation with ansible, but is still very much functioning.

The main features of this script are idempotence, logging and cool looking terminal responses are achieved by moving the cursor:
